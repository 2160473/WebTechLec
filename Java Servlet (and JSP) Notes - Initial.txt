SERVER SIDE WEB-SCRIPTING

Java Servlets
	- Java Servlets are used to extend the capabilities of servers and implement web applications.
	- A Java Servlet is typically a Java object that runs inside a Servlet container and responds to HTTP requests.
		*Java Container 
			- also known as a Web Container
			- Interacts with Java Servlets, and is responsible for managing a Servlet's lifecycle. 
				e.g. Tomcat, Glassfish, Jetty, Virgo, WildFly
	- Web technology for Java
	- Typically run on the HTTP Protocol
	- Part of the Java EE / Java Enterprise Edition
 * Java Servlet Packages
	- javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http

Java Servlet Versions

	1. J2EE 1.2 (December 12, 1999)
	2. J2EE 1.3 (September 24, 2001)
	3. J2EE 1.4 (November 11, 2003)
	4. Java EE 5 (May 11, 2006) 
	5. Java EE 6 (December 10, 2009)
	6. Java EE 7 (June 12, 2013)
	7. Java EE 8 (September 21, 2017)

Java Servlets Lifecycle
	- provides the environment in which the servlet runs.
	
	1. Java Servlet Instantiation
		- constructor call
		- the container creates an instance of the servlet class 
		- invoked implicitly

	2. Initialization 
                - A Java Servlet is initialized by calling the init() method
		- The init() method is invoked only once. 
		- When a servlet is invoked, a single instance of each servlet gets created.
		- The  init() method creates / loads data that will be used in the lifecycle of a servlet.

	3. Request Handling 
		- service() method
		- The service() method is invoked at every client request.
		- The service() method has the parameters HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse.
		* Care must be exercised to ensure that the code run by the servlet is thread-safe since multiple client-requests
		  are handled by single, multi-threaded servlet instance.

	4. Destruction
		- destroy() method
		- The destroy() method is invoked only once before the servlet is unloaded.
		- After the destroy() method has been called, the servlet object is marked for garbage collection.

HTTP Servlet
		- an HTTP servlet handles HTTP request and provides an HTTP Response.	
		- HttpServlet is present in the javax.servlet.http package.
		- Extend the GenericServletClass	

	 HTTP Servlet Request 
		- binds the request information like the header and request methods.
		- sent by the client and received by the servlet
		- extends the GenericServletClass
			e.g. HTTP Request Method, Request URI, Query String, Message Headers, Message Payload etc.

	 HTTP Servlet Response
		- Binds all information of the HTTP protocol
	        - Generated by the client and sent back to the requesting client
		

SERVLETS - FORM DATA
    
    - a browser uses two method to pass information to the web server:
		1. Get Method
			- the Get Method requests the data from a specified resource.
			- default method to pass information from browser to web server.

		2. Post Method
			- submits the processed data to a specified resource

III. **HANDLING FROM DATA SUBMISSION(GET)
IV.  **HANDLING FROM DATA SUBMISSION(POST)
V.   **HANDLING FILE UPLOADS



VI. Dynamic Content (with Database Access)
	- dynamic content do not exist as they are fetched
	- dynamic content are created by the server in the fly




VII. Dynamic Content via AJAX (with Database Access)





Servlets and Java Server Pages(JSP)
	- JSP is a technology for devleoping dynamic web pages.
	- Used to implement the GUI Part of an application.
