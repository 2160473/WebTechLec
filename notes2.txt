HTTP Fundamentals:
1. Cache Control 
- having a copy in the local storage speeds up things


2. Content Media Type Specification 
- is negotiated between the client and the server
- how we specify the type of resource

3. Content Negotiation
- mechanisms that make it possible to erve different versions of a document
-media type, language, etc

4. Content / Transfer Codings
-perform some transformation of the content before you send it
e.g compression (ZIP)

5. Client Server Protocol Negotiations
-how clients and servers negotiate between themselves and switch protocols

6. Persistent connections
- was introduced in http 1.1

7. Request Pipelining/multiplexing
 
8. Authorization

HTTP RESOURCE ADDRESSING:
-resources in HTTP are identified using URI's (Uniform Resource Identifier) 
 * to access something on the web you must identify its location
 * script - reads profile data from a database

scheme
 - either http or https

authority
 - authentication credentials / user information 
 - host: domain name of the server where the resource resides, or where the resource will be created

path to resource 
 - may refer to a static or dynamic resource

query
 - typically provided as key=value pairs with ampersand separators between key value pairs

fragment identifier
- points to a subordinate resource
