CSS HISTORY
 -written by Marc Andreesen in 1994 
 - declarative programming language
	- rules for the HTML documentare described one by one and browses handle the rendering


CSS RULE PREFERENCE

CSS DECLARATIONS

- a CSS rule-set is divided into two; a selector and a declaration block

h1 (selector) {color:yellow; font-size:14px;} (declaration)
               property -- value -- property --value
Selector - points to the HTML element you want to style
Declaration Block - contains one or more declarations separated by semi-colons

** CSS Declarations always end with a semi-colon

A. Shorthand Properties
     - allows authors to specify multiple values
     - one example of a shorthand property is the CSS background propery, that able's to define values of
	-background-color
	-background-image
	-background-repeat
	-background-position
 * another example
	font-style: italic;
	font-weight: bold;
	font-size: .10em;
	line-height: 1.4;
	font-family; Arial, helvetica;
    this can be shortened to: font: talic bold .10em/1.4 Arial, helvetica;

** CSS has a universal shorthand property "all"
	-this applies its value to every property in the document
	1. inherit - Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as that of its parent element.
	2. initial - Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as the value set for that element in the browser's default style sheet. If no value is set by the browser's default style sheet and the property is naturally inherited, then the property value is set to inherit instead.
	3. revert - Reverts the property to the value it would have had if the current origin had not applied any styles to it. In other words, the property's value is set to the user stylesheet's value for the property (if one is set), otherwise the property's value is taken from the user-agent's default stylesheet.
	4. unset - Resets the property to its natural value, which means that if the property is naturally inherited it acts like inherit, otherwise it acts like initial.



example:
body {
  color: green;
}

.inherit a {
  color: inherit;
}

.initial a {
  color: initial;
}

.unset a {
  color: unset;
}
