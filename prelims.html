				<ul>
					<li><em>The web makes use of the interconnectivity structure of the Internet and is not the Internet itself.</em></li>
					<li>A collection of web resources and applications via the Internet (Internetwork “connection across boundaries”).</li>
					<li>Contains hypermedia; one document that contains links to other documents.</li>
					<li>Considered to be today’s greatest information system.</li>
					<li>Inventor: Tim Berners-Lee (1989), he worked at CERN(Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire) and was appointed as a knight. He was the one who thought of putting HTTP, HTML and URL together but did not invent each.</li>
					<li>Early motivation for the creation of the World Wide Web was for sharing of scientific papers.</li>
					<li>Web Resources can be static, already existing, or dynamic, produced on the fly, example is search engine results.</li>
					<li>“SPIDERS” are applications that crawls the web to gather as much information as possible.</li>
					<li>Other platforms that did not win over the WWW are Gopher(Menu Based) and WAIS (Wide Area Information Server).</li>

                    <li> HTTP 1.0
                        <br>- status code definitions and header field definitions were introduced.

                    <br>
                    <li> HTTP 1.1 
                        <br>- standardized protocol
                        <br>- included the following improvements:

                        <br>- persistent connection

                        <br>- Server Push is an added feature that volunteers information to the client. The intention is to lessen load time since the server would send all the resources need already
                        <br>- Pipelining, which sends requests continuously instead of waiting for the response before being able to make another request goal: transfer resources faster over the world wide web

                <p>
                    HTML is a language used to mark-up web pages in the World Wide Web. 
                    <br><br>
                    It is an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML),a language used to define markup 
                    languages or a meta-language ,which is a standard revolving around the concept of structures existing in documents. 
                    <br><br>
                    HTML has been used to specify the structure and content of web pages in the web, as well as its aesthetics but was later
                    on deprecated due to the existence and dominance of style sheets.
                    <br><br>
                    Semantic VS. Non-Semantic Coding:
                    <br>• Semantic Coding refers to utilizing elements of a document the way they're intended to be used.
                    <br>• Non-semantic coding, on the other hand, uses different elements and entities of a document in a
		non-conventional manner or in a way which defies its purpose, usually for presentational aspects.

                <ol>
                    <li> HTML 1.0
                        <br>- first release of HTML in the world (1991)
                        <br>- a hybrid of SGML
                        <br>- language is limiting

                    <br>
                    <li> HTML 2.0
                        <br>- released in 1994
                        <br>- first official set of standards for HTML
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> HTML 3.0
                        <br>- Netscape added new proprietary tags(only works on certain browsers) which pushed David Raggett to add more abilities to HTML
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> HTML 3.2
                        <br>- first version to be released as a W3C recommendation
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> HTML 4.0
                        <br>- last iteration of the classic HTML
                        <br>- in 1998, it became the official standard
                        <br>- supports cascading style sheets
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> HTML 4.01
                        <br>- corrected HTML 4.0 and became HTML 4.01
                        <br>- final version of HTML 4.0
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> XHTML (2002-2003)
                        <br>- Coming from the flexible world of HTML, W3C wanted to make things more stricter by adding XML to HTML and calling it XHTML. The intentions were good but it was not used by most developers that were used to the 	flexibility of HTML and even by browsers because of the big discrepancy of what was already existing.
                        <br>- XHTML has all the elements and attributes of HTML but with stricter implementations. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> HTML5
                        <br>- Ian Hickson started a breakaway group from XHTML, forming the group WHATWG. They aimed to put a cease to the strict implementations of XHTML and bring back what developers were used to  and what browsers already supported, which was HTML, and modernize the language. 
						The group considered this to be a more pragmatic approach to further developing the technology, rather than XHTML, which was an abrupt change. 
                        <br>- Initially, W3C did not support the idea and disapprove of the proposal which lead to them creating the breakaway group. 
						Since, HTML5 became more popular with developers because of its backward compatibility, W3C eventually supported the idea and joined the group in 2006. 
						The first draft of HTML was released in 2008, editor being Ian Hickson. Their projection was that HTML5 would be a specification in the year 2022, but the adoption to HTML5 was rapid. 
						Reasons HTML5 was easily adapted includes the huge development in mobile technology, and the death of Flash technology, thanks to the late Steve Jobs that declared they would not be using it in their IOS devices. 
						The first standard recommendation for HTML5 was in 2014, way earlier than the projected year.
                        <br>- HTML5 is a combination of HTML4, XHTML and the DOM(Document Object Model) technology. Meaning there are two ways of writing in HTML5, the flexible way or the more stricter way. The name XHTML5 was considered but then later on disregarded.
                        <br>- HTML5.1(2016) and HTML5.2(2017) included minor revisions.

                    - DOCTYPE is used to indicate that the document is following standards, which would enable browsers to render the document in standards mode rendering. Quirks mode rendering in browsers are used for "malformed" documents, with no DOCTYPE heading.Different browsers may have different ways of rendering in quirks mode. An example that leads to a documents invalidity or malformity is misnesting of tags. 3 flavors of HTML4 are strict, transitional and framesets and have longer DOCTYPE headings.
